### Hello World ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a civil engineer at the beginning of my path to becoming a programmer and changing construction design to application design. Iâ€™m a Python enthusiast who constantly tries to expand his knowledge. I focus on ongoing development of skills through realising courses and building my own projects. I like to get to know new languages, frameworks and every new technology that allows me to become a better programmer. Iâ€™ve gained a lot of valuable knowledge in Python programming and other technologies during my bootcamp course at Software Developer Academy. As a junior construction designer Iâ€™ve improved not only analytical, but also communication and teamwork skills. I believe that my life career and self-development path will help me in my future as a programmer. Because this is not only coding, this is evolving my passion.
